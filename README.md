# Rock-Paper-Scissors
TOP - first javascript project
This project will be an entry into problem solving 
I will be demonstrating my aquired skills in Javascript thus far being:
* Functions 
* Conditional statements 
* Operators 

Down the line I plan to eventually add a GUI for the game, In the meanwhile it can be acessed via the console
